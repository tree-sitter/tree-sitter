# Introduction

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:

* **General** enough to parse any programming language
* **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
* **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure [C](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib)) can be embedded in any application
