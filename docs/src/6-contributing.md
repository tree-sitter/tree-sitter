## Code of Conduct

Contributors to Tree-sitter should abide by the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].

## Developing Tree-sitter

### Prerequisites

To make changes to Tree-sitter, you should have:

1. A C compiler, for compiling the core library and the generated parsers.
2. A [Rust toolchain][rust], for compiling the Rust bindings, the highlighting library, and the CLI.
3. Node.js and NPM, for generating parsers from `grammar.js` files.
4. Either [Emscripten][emscripten], [Docker][docker], or [podman][podman] for
compiling the library to WASM.

### Building

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter
cd tree-sitter
```

Optionally, build the WASM library. If you skip this step, then the `tree-sitter playground` command will require an internet
connection. If you have Emscripten installed, this will use your `emcc` compiler. Otherwise, it will use Docker or Podman:

```sh
cargo xtask build-wasm
```

Build the Rust libraries and the CLI:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

This will create the `tree-sitter` CLI executable in the `target/release` folder.

If you want to automatically install the `tree-sitter` CLI in your system, you can run:

```sh
cargo install --path cli
```

If you're going to be in a fast iteration cycle and would like the CLI to build faster, you can use the `release-dev` profile:

```sh
cargo build --release --profile release-dev
# or
cargo install --path cli --profile release-dev
```

### Testing

Before you can run the tests, you need to fetch some upstream grammars that are used for testing:

```sh
cargo xtask fetch-fixtures
```

To test any changes you've made to the CLI, you can regenerate these parsers using your current CLI code:

```sh
cargo xtask generate-fixtures
```

Then you can run the tests:

```sh
cargo xtask test
```

Similarly, to test the WASM binding, you need to compile these parsers to WASM:

```sh
cargo xtask generate-fixtures --wasm
cargo xtask test-wasm
```

### Debugging

The test script has a number of useful flags. You can list them all by running `cargo xtask test -h`.
Here are some of the main flags:

If you want to run a specific unit test, pass its name (or part of its name) as an argument:

```sh
cargo xtask test test_does_something
```

You can run the tests under the debugger (either `lldb` or `gdb`) using the `-g` flag:

```sh
cargo xtask test -g test_does_something
```

Part of the Tree-sitter test suite involves parsing the _corpus_ tests for several languages and performing randomized edits
to each example in the corpus. If you just want to run the tests for a particular _language_, you can pass the `-l` flag.
Additionally, if you want to run a particular _example_ from the corpus, you can pass the `-e` flag:

```sh
cargo xtask test -l javascript -e Arrays
```

## Published Packages

The main [`tree-sitter/tree-sitter`][ts repo] repository contains the source code for
several packages that are published to package registries for different languages:

* Rust crates on [crates.io][crates]:
  * [`tree-sitter`][lib crate] — A Rust binding to the core library
  * [`tree-sitter-highlight`][highlight crate] — The syntax-highlighting library
  * [`tree-sitter-cli`][cli crate] — The command-line tool

* JavaScript modules on [npmjs.com][npmjs]:
  * [`web-tree-sitter`][web-ts] — A WASM-based JavaScript binding to the core library
  * [`tree-sitter-cli`][cli package] — The command-line tool

There are also several other dependent repositories that contain other published packages:

* [`tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter`][node ts] — Node.js bindings to the core library,
published as [`tree-sitter`][node package] on npmjs.com
* [`tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter`][py ts] — Python bindings to the core library,
published as [`tree-sitter`][py package] on [PyPI.org][pypi].
* [`tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter`][go ts] — Go bindings to the core library,
published as [`tree_sitter`][go package] on [pkg.go.dev][go.dev].

## Publishing New Releases (Maintainers Only)

Publishing a new release of the CLI and lib requires these steps:

1. Commit and push all outstanding changes and verify that CI passes:

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Fix things"
   git push
   ```

2. Upgrade manifest files and create a new tag:

   ```sh
   cargo xtask bump-version --version <NEXT_VERSION>
   ```

   This will determine the current version, increment the version to the one specified, and update the relevant files for
   Rust, Node, Zig, CMake, and Make. It will then create a commit and a tag for the new version. For more information
   about the arguments that are allowed, see the documentation for the [`npm version`][npm version] command.

3. Push the commit and the tag:

   ```sh
   git push
   git push --tags
   ```

4. CI will build the binaries and upload them to the GitHub release and the NPM registry. It will also publish the Rust
crates to crates.io.
