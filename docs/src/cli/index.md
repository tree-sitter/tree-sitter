# CLI Overview

The `tree-sitter` command-line interface is used to create, manage, test, and build tree-sitter parsers. It is controlled by

- a personal `tree-sitter/config.json` config file generated by [`tree-sitter init-config`](./init-config.md)
- a parser `tree-sitter.json` config file generated by [`tree-sitter init`](./init.md).
