## About queries

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations. The [query type](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.

For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#about-queries).

> [!NOTE]
> For {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} requests made with user access tokens, you should use separate queries for issues and pull requests. For example, use the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` filters and their equivalents. Using the `search` connection to return a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query will result in an empty set of nodes.
