 * * Types such as `funcref` cannot cross stores.
 * * Types such as `externref` have valid reference counts.
 *
 * It's generally only recommended to use this if your application can wrap
 * this in a safe embedding. This should not be frequently used due to the
 * number of invariants that must be upheld on the wasm<->host boundary. On the
 * upside, though, this flavor of host function will be faster to call than
